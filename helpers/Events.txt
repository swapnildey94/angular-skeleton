Angular supports 2 types of event strategies
	in controllers communication.

a. Bubbling (Bottom->Up)
b. Tunneling (Top->Down)

If a controller needs to communicate with it's parent scopes, it's good to have event bubbling.

On the other hand, if a controller needs to communicate with it's child scopes,
	it's good to have event tunneling.

A scope has following 4 methods used for eventing.

Subscribers:
a. $on - register the event handler
b. $off - unregister the event handler

Publishers:
c. $emit - bubbling
d. $broadcast - tunneling
